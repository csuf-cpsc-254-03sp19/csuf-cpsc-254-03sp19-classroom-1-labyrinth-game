This application is a light labyrinth game providing a single player mode against a AI.

You can start the game just by launching the application for your operating machine in the ./Builds directory. (Linux)

IMPORTANT: You may have to provide the right of execution, for this, rightclick the `Labyrinth.x86_64` file and select properties. Here switch to Permissions and check `Allow exectuing file as program.` (Or use the command for the command line.)

When you want to contribute, you have to download the godot-Engine here:
https://godotengine.org/download/

Just download the file and execute it - there is no installation needed.
After launching the application, a inquiry asks you, where to locate your program. Just choose the path on your drive (open the path ./LabyrinthGame), then the engine should detect the application and you can start contributing.

For further information you may read the Project Report (located in ./Project_Report/Project_Report.pdf)
