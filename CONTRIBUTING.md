You may find a very good documentation for programming at:
https://docs.godotengine.org

Especially for this project, we refer to: 
https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/classes/class_tilemap.html?highlight=tilemap - for the TileMap (Grid)
https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html?highlight=first%20game - for the introduction in the game


Expectations to all contributors:
1) We expect, that you only push code to the master branch, when you are sure, that the program runs without any iusses. You may merge on your local machine without pushing it to the remote server and test it.
2) When you aren't sure, if it runs without iusses, just push your current working branch to the GIT. May another developer can try finding the error.
3) Push only with good commit messages and ensure, you're merged the files carefully.
